# hello-world
My first repo :)

This is my first edit to a branch in github.
I'm not stupid, but I'm nervous about going back to school and learning all these new tools, quickly enough/well enough to succeed in this OMSA program.

Here's an edit that I'm making on the readme-edits branch, learning about branching and pull requests.  A pull request is a request to pull my proposed changes into their branch.  I can @mention people to ask for feedback on my proposal, even before I'm done with my changes (?).
